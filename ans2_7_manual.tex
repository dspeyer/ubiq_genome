As with hackathon1, only some of the reads could be aligned and of those only portions of them.  The usual concerns about selection bias apply.  Furthermore, finding the reference sequence for alignments to the complement strand proved difficult, so we offer here only the reads which aligned to the template strand.

This table shows count of nucleotides from those alignments.  Rows indicate the nucleotide in the reference genome, columns in the read returned by MinION.
