We could have PCRed the DNA with random primers to have more copies of
fewer fragments, then gotten some redundancy and used that to
cross-check.

We can look at the quality scores and only pay attention to high ones
(though we saw last time that those aren't very good).

We can only believe polymorphisms that are known to be in $>$1\% of the population
