\subsection*{1D reads}

        The following histograms show the length distribution of 1D reads (both template and complement) for passes and fails.

          &
          \includegraphics[width=.48\textwidth]{1Dfailures}
          \\
          Passed Reads
          &
          Failed Reads
        \end{tabular}
        

\subsection*{2D reads}

        The following histograms show the length distribution of 2D reads for passes and fails.
