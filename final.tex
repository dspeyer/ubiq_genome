218 channels had at least one read. 
The average channel had 14.8 reads. 
Channel 212 had 95 reads, which was the most.

Just for fun, here's a histogram of reads per channel\\

\section*{Problem 4}
Let us zoom in a little on the previous graphes:

\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{q4qh}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{q4hh}

The first quarter hour appears linear, but the first half hour does not.


Over the first half hour, the rate was 1121.4 base pairs per second.  Therefore, to handle the 3 billion base pairs of the human genome would take 743.1 hours.

\section*{Problem 11}
\subsection*{Simple Model}

        The simplest possible model is the one in which the number of nucleotides determines the read duration,
        possibly with some constant term for getting started.  To consider this, we start with a scatterplot of
        bases against time with a linear fit.

        \includegraphics[width=3in]{part11scatterbd}

        We might be tempted to include a constant term in our fitting, but as should be apparent, it would be
        negative.  How long it would take to sequence an extremely short read is unclear.  Fortunately, there 
        are none in our sample.
        
Cost per nucleotide: 11.25ms\\

(Red circles are template strand; blue are complement.  There appears to be no significant difference between them.)

\subsection*{Nucleotide Model}
Cost per nucleotide: 
A=32ms 
C=-07ms 
G=04ms 
T=12ms

\subsection*{2mer Model}

        We can use a model in which each the time to extend by one nucleotide is determined by the 2-mer in the middle of the
        pore.  We can not list all the costs, but here's a histogram:

\subsection*{3mer Model}

        We can use a model in which each the time to extend by one nucleotide is determined by the 3-mer in the middle of the
        pore.  We can not list all the costs, but here's a histogram:
        
\includegraphics[width=3in]{part11hist3}\\
\includegraphics[width=4in]{part11scatter3mer}

$r^2=0.91$

\subsection*{4mer Model}

        We can use a model in which each the time to extend by one nucleotide is determined by the 4-mer in the middle of the
        pore.  We can not list all the costs, but here's a histogram:
        
\includegraphics[width=3in]{part11hist4}\\
\includegraphics[width=4in]{part11scatter4mer}

$r^2=0.94$

\subsection*{5mer Model}

        We can use a model in which each the time to extend by one nucleotide is determined by the 5-mer in the middle of the
        pore.  We can not list all the costs, but here's a histogram:
