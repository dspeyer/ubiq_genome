2 channels had at least one read, and 1 had at least five.  
This compares with 434 ``active'' channels during initialization, and 651 immediately after loading fuel

The average channel had 1262.0 reads. 
Channel 29 had 2520 reads, which was the most.

Just for fun, here's a histogram of reads per channel\\

\section*{Problem 4}
\subsection*{1D reads}

        The following histograms show the length distribution of 1D reads (both template and complement) for passes and fails.

\subsection*{2D reads}

        The following histograms show the length distribution of 2D reads for passes and fails.

\subsection*{1D and 2D reads}

        The following histogramss show the cumulative length distribution of both 1D and 2D reads for passes and fails.
