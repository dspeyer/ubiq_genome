1 channels had at least one read, and 1 had at least five.  
This compares with 434 ``active'' channels during initialization, and 651 immediately after loading fuel

The average channel had 2520.0 reads. 
Channel 29 had 2520 reads, which was the most.
\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{Failed Reads}

        The following histograms show the length distribution of 2D and 1D reads for fails.

          2D Reads
          &
          1D Reads
        \end{tabular}

\subsection*{Passed Reads}

        The following histograms show the length distribution of 2D and 1D reads for passes.
