}}Rs2856758 is a SNP in the [[CCR5]] gene (CC-chemokine receptor type 5). Variants in [[CCR5]] are associated with resistance to [[HIV]] infection. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011079] 

Another mutation in this gene, [[rs333]] (also known as the CCR5-delta32 deletion), is associated with resistance to HIV. This mutation may have spread in the European population in response to selection pressure from plague (Black Death) or smallpox. [http://www.pnas.org/content/100/25/15276.long]
