Q3:
Runs via q3.py. Call as follows: python q3.py PATHTODIR/WHEREHACKATHON/DOWNLOADSFILELOCATED/
The script q3.py plots the cumulative nucleotides/basepairs sequenced as a function of time for both 'failed' and 'passed' reads by running the command:
>poretools yield_plot --plot-type basepairs --saveas '"+path+"cumnucfail.png' '"+path+"downloads/PASSORFAIL/
The resulting .png files are saved to the working directory as cumnucpass.png and cumnucfail.png


Q4:
Runs via q4.py. Call as follows: python q4.py PATHTODIR/WHEREHACKATHON/DOWNLOADSFILELOCATED/
The script q4.py saves the data frame to the working directory as a .txt file, passdf.txt.


Q10:
Runs via q10.py. Call as follows: python q10.py PATHTODIR/WHEREHACKATHON/DOWNLOADSFILELOCATED/
The script q10.py defines the nucleotide composition of both 'passed' and 'failed' sequences by running the command:
>poretools nucdist path/downloads/PASSORFAIL/
The output is processed, so that the percentage of each nucleotide is printed. The results were as follows:

Failed reads %Composition
% A: 26.8544936058
% C: 22.6248607838
% T: 26.8972371186
% G: 23.6234084919

Passed reads %Composition
% A: 27.8932849874
% C: 21.7440845108
% T: 27.990263778
% G: 22.3723667238
